# Employee Tracker

## Description

This code creates and updates a MySQL database by getting input from the command prompt.  The database has multiple tables that were seeded with a few entries. The tables have primary and foreign keys to reference each other and allow tables to interact with each other.  The code uses Inquirer, MySql2, and Console Table from Node Packet Manger (npm).

To run the code, run "node index.js"
